# Cheers 👋

I'm **Giovanni**, a developer with a background in **philosophy and education**.

## 👨‍💻 What I do

- 🌱 I'm learning **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, and **PHP** to expand my developer toolkit  
- 💡 I'm passionate about creating tools that solve real-world problems — like my app for finding **free parking spots**  
- 🤝 I enjoy collaborating on **thoughtful**, **challenging** projects, especially those that involve **new technologies** and a **human touch**

## 💬 Let's talk about

- Philosophy, ethics, and the role of technology in society  
- How code and creativity come together to make something personal
- Star Craft II and other nerdy stuff

## 🌍 A bit more about me

Before diving into tech, I was a **teacher and coordinator**. I still value **clear communication**, **continuous learning**, and **collaborative relationships** more than any single framework.
